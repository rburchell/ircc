what is this?
=============

ircc is an ncurses IRC client, originally (and now very vaguely) based on torc,
a PHP4 IRC client by rainman <rainman@darkwired.org>.

ircc features a class-based design, seperate (reloadable, thanks to a PHP hack)
commands, and a fairly simple ncurses interface that happened to more or less
look and feel how I wanted it.

I never really completed it. Put to public in case someone ever wants to make use
of it somehow.
