/SET values
-----------

1. Introduction
This file documents the possible settings for /set values and what they do.
Of course, additional /set keys may be used by third party code.
None of these will be documented here.

/set timestamp/format timestamp format here
This value sets how timestamps are to be formatted.
For reference on possible format, see the PHP manual: http://uk3.php.net/date
(an example might be [h:m:s] for output like [22:10:36]).

/set buffer/scroll multiplier here
This value sets how much of a "screen" page up/down scroll.
The default is 0.5, which is half a screen.
Personally, I prefer 0.6/0.7.
